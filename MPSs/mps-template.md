## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the problem being addressed. This should summarize the gap or challenge without proposing specific solutions.

## Vision

Describe the ideal future state. What does success look like once the problems identified in this MPS are addressed? This section establishes the north star that guides solution development.

## Problem

Describe the current challenges in detail. What friction exists? What gaps have been identified? What feedback has the community provided? Be specific about pain points while remaining solution-agnostic.

The problem description should be:
- Factual and evidence-based where possible
- Focused on impact to developers, users, or the ecosystem
- Scoped appropriately (neither too broad nor too narrow)

## Use Cases

Provide concrete scenarios that illustrate the problems. Each use case should:
- Describe a real developer or user need
- Explain how current limitations create friction
- Demonstrate why addressing this problem matters

## Goals

List the high-level objectives that solutions should achieve. Goals should be:
- Measurable where possible
- Focused on outcomes rather than implementations
- Prioritized if some goals are more critical than others

## Expected Outcomes

Describe the benefits the ecosystem will realize once the problems are addressed.
What improvements will developers and users experience? How will adoption or productivity change?

## Open Questions

List unresolved questions that require further discussion or investigation.
These may inform solution design or require input from specific stakeholders.

## Recommended MIPs

List the MIPs recommended to address the problem domains identified in this MPS.
For each recommended MIP, provide:
- A descriptive title
- A brief summary of what the MIP should address
- How it relates to the problems identified above

## References (Optional)

List any external sources, prior discussions, or related documents that inform this MPS.

## Acknowledgements

List contributors who helped develop this MPS, including workshop participants, reviewers, and community members who provided feedback.
